in the src folder the main.ts file is the entry point to the NEST.js

in the "src" folder initial file is below
app.controller.specs.ts => this file  is for unit testing purpose we dont need this file initially so 
we have deleted this file from the folder

NestFactory is use to cereate the new nest.js application

The most important part in the NEST is the "controller" and "provider"

controller control that how you handle the request,
that accept the request doing something and return a response

provider are the extra classes which you can inject into controller

In the app.module.ts class the
@Module is the decorator that should be attached to the AppModule class initially this class should be empty 
but the @Module are the decorator to this class.

// controller and get decorator are comming from the nestjs and controller() decorator is attached to a class
// whereas @get() decorator is attached to a method instead of class
